## SQL JOINs

JOINs merge related data from multiple tables together into a result set.

The two most common types of joins are:

* INNER JOIN
* OUTER JOIN


### INNER JOINs

INNER JOINs return rows that match from both tables.

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table 1> 
    INNER JOIN <table 2> ON <table 1>.<column> = <table 2>.<column>;


SELECT <columns> FROM <table 1> AS <table 1 alias> 
    INNER JOIN <table 2> AS <table 2 alias> ON <table 1 alias>.<column> = <table 2 alias>.<column>;

```

Examples:

```
SELECT product_name, category FROM products
    INNER JOIN product_categories ON products.category_id = product_categories.id;
SELECT products.product_name, product_categories.category FROM products
    INNER JOIN product_categories ON products.category_id = product_categories.id;
SELECT p.product_name, c.category FROM products AS p
    INNER JOIN product_categories AS c ON p.category_id = c.id;        
```

INNER JOINing multiple tables:

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table 1> 
    INNER JOIN <table 2> ON <table 1>.<column> = <table 2>.<column>
    INNER JOIN <table 3> ON <table 1>.<column> = <table 3>.<column>;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT users.full_name, sales.amount, products.name FROM sales 
        INNER JOIN users ON sales.user_id = users.id
        INNER JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.id;
```

### OUTER JOINs

There are 3 types of OUTER JOINs:

* LEFT OUTER JOIN - JOINs all matching data and all non-matching rows from the _left_ table in the query
* RIGHT OUTER JOIN - JOINs all matching data and all non-matching rows from the _right_ table in the query
* FULL OUTER JOIN - JOINs all matching data and then all non-matching rows from both tables.

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <left table> 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN <right right> ON <left table>.<column> = <right table>.<column>;


SELECT <columns> FROM <left table> AS <left alias> 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN <right table> AS <right alias> 
        ON <left alias>.<column> = <right alias>.<column>;

```

#### Example

If you wanted to get the product count for every category, 
even categories without products, an `OUTER JOIN` is the best solution. 
The following two examples will yield the same results, however one is a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and one is a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`.

```
SELECT categories.name, COUNT(products.id) AS "Product Count" FROM categories
    LEFT OUTER JOIN products ON categories.id = products.category_id;

SELECT categories.name, COUNT(products.id) AS "Products Count" FROM products
    RIGHT OUTER JOIN categories ON categories.id = products.category_id;
```

## Set Operations


Set operations merge data in to one set based on column definitions and the data contained within each column.

The four set operations are:

* UNION
* UNION ALL
* INTERSECT
* EXCEPT

The number of columns need to match. If number of columns don't match it'll result in an error.

```
<query 1> <set operation> <query 2>
SELECT <column> FROM <table 1> <set operation> SELECT <column> FROM <table 2>;
SELECT <column>, <column> FROM <table 1> <set operation> SELECT <column>, <column> FROM <table 2>;
```

### UNION Examples

UNIONs return all distinct values from both data sets with no duplicates.

Get a list of unique restaurants from both north and south malls.

```
SELECT store FROM mall_south WHERE type = "restaurant"
    UNION 
SELECT store FROM mall_north WHERE type = "restaurant";
```

Get a list of unique classes taught in two schools. Order them by their class name.

```
SELECT evening_class FROM school_1 UNION SELECT evening_class FROM school_2
    ORDER BY evening_class ASC;
```

### UNION ALL

UNION ALL returns all values from both data sets â€“ with duplicates.

Get a list of all names for boys and girls and order them by name.

```
SELECT boy_name AS name FROM boy_baby_names 
    UNION ALL 
SELECT girl_name AS name FROM girl_baby_names
    ORDER by name;
```

### INTERSECT

Returns only values that are in both data sets.

Get list of classes offered in both schools.

```
SELECT evening_class FROM school_1 INTERSECT SELECT evening_class FROM school_2
    ORDER BY evening_class ASC;
```
Get list of restaurants at both mall locations.

```
SELECT store FROM mall_south WHERE type = "restaurant"
    INTERSECT 
SELECT store FROM mall_north WHERE type = "restaurant";
```

### EXCEPT

Returns data from the first data set that's not in the second.

Get a list of local stores in a mall.

```
SELECT store FROM mall
    EXCEPT
SELECT store FROM all_stores WHERE type = "national"
```


## Subqueries

Subqueries are queries within queries. A subquery can also be called an _inner_ query with the "parent" query being called the _outer_ query.

There are two main ways to use a subquery:

1. In an `IN` condition
2. As a derived or temporary table

A subquery in an `IN` condition must only have one column.

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table 1> WHERE <table 1>.<column> IN (<subquery>);
SELECT <columns> FROM <table 1> 
    WHERE <table 1>.<column> IN (SELECT <a single column> FROM <table 2> WHERE <condition>);
```

Examples:

Get a list of user's names and emails for users who have spent over 100 dollars in a single transaction.

```
SELECT name, email FROM users 
    WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT(user_id) FROM sales WHERE saleAmount > 100);

// OR

SELECT name, email FROM users
    INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(user_id) FROM sales WHERE saleAmount > 100) AS best_customers
    ON users.id = best_customers.user_id;
```

Get a list of user's names and emails for users who have spent over 1000 dollars in total.

```
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM sales WHERE SUM(saleAmount) > 1000 GROUP BY user_id);

// OR

SELECT name, email, total FROM users 
    INNER JOIN (SELECT user_id, SUM(saleAmount) AS total FROM sales WHERE total > 1000 GROUP BY user_id) AS ultimate_customers
    ON users.id = ultimate_customers.user_id;
```
